~ Interactive Resume Website + Password Strength Checker ~

This project is a fully responsive personal résumé website that I built to highlight my technical skills,
showcase my work, and create a clean online presence that recruiters can easily explore. It also
includes a standalone Password Strength Checker that demonstrates my understanding of web
security, UI feedback, and client-side validation.
The site is designed to be simple, fast, and accessible — but also polished enough to feel modern and
intentional.


~ Overview ~

This project brings together two things I'm passionate about:

1) creating clean, user-friendly interfaces
2) building tools that actually help people understand security.


The website works as an interactive résumé with organized, card-based content, quick navigation, and
print-friendly formatting. The Password Strength Checker is a separate mini-application that evaluates
password complexity in real time using JavaScript.


~ Features ~

• Fully responsive layout (mobile, tablet, desktop)
• Light/Dark mode with saved user preference
• Smooth card-based design
• “Chip” style highlights
• Sticky navigation + dropdown menu
• Clean print-ready formatting

Password Strength Checker

• Upper/lowercase, numbers, symbols, pattern checks
• Strength labels from Weak → Very Strong
• Built with vanilla JavaScript


~ Technologies Used ~

HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript, CSS Variables, Flexbox, Grid, LocalStorage API

~ How It Works ~

• Theme toggle uses data-theme + localStorage.
• Print styles clean the layout for resumes.
• Password checker analyzes length, character mix, and patterns.
